# Stock Price Prediction with LSTM Model

## Overview

Welcome to the repository for the Stock Price Prediction project, where we leverage cutting-edge machine learning techniques to forecast Nvidia's future stock prices. This implementation features a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model built with the Keras framework, complemented by advanced data preprocessing using Pandas and efficient data manipulation with NumPy.

## Key Features

- **Machine Learning Methodology:** Implement an LSTM model using Keras for precise stock price predictions.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Employ advanced Pandas techniques for data preprocessing to enhance the model's efficacy.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Conduct a thorough EDA, including trend analysis, feature selection, and robust statistical assessments.
- **Data Visualization:** Generate insightful visualizations with Matplotlib to distill complex financial data into actionable insights.

## Factors Considered

- **Microeconomic and Macroeconomic Analysis:** Assess the intricate interplay between microeconomic and macroeconomic factors, including:
  - Financial metrics
  - Supplier stock prices (TSM and AMAT)
  - S&P 500 performance
  - GDP trends
  - Inflation rates
  - Interest rates
- **Correlation Analysis:** Calculate correlation coefficients to quantify relationships between these variables and Nvidia’s stock performance.

## Results and Report

Produce an insightful and data-driven report highlighting compelling reasons for caution in considering Nvidia stock investments. The analysis is grounded in microeconomic and macroeconomic risks, addressing concerns related to potential overvaluation, the presence of potential AI and GPU market bubbles, geopolitical factors such as the US-China trade tensions, and the LSTM model’s predictions.
